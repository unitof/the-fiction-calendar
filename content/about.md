An idea had by [Jacob Ford](jacobford.com) while watching [What is this?](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/what-is-this-video) which is part of [What football will look like in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/) which is made by John Bois.

In [chapter 3](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/what-is-this-video) (which is a video), a transcript of satellites talking to each other says people stopped being born (and dying and aging) on April 7, 2026.

I paused the video and added that as an all-day event to my iOS calendar.

Then thought it’d be cool to have a calendar of all fictional events with real dates attached.

I decided to quickly make it while still under the cherished [understanding](https://archive.vn/DBH5l#20%) that nobody else had.

Hopefully other people contribute stuff because I'm not actually a voracious reader. I'm building it so that all contributions come in through GitHub, inspired by how [Homebrew does its thing](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Still haven’t gotten back to finishing 17776.

## The Rules (v0.0.1canary)

- Event titles take their wording directly from the source, but converted to present tense
  - There's a field to record the original quote as well
- Only events which have a specific date (not just a year)
  - Best if the date is explicitly stated in the work, but okay if you have to do a little inferring, as long as it's incontrovertible
- Only events which have general relevance (something you’d be likely to read in the news if it actually happened and was known about, not just something that happened to a fictional character)
- Multiple events from a single work are okay, but try to condense events involving the same character/thing/happening to one or two (eg: when something started and when it ended)
