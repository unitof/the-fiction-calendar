An idea had by [Jacob Ford](jacobford.com) while watching [What is this?](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/what-is-this-video) which is part of [What football will look like in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/) which is made by John Bois.

I decided to quickly make it while still under the cherished [understanding](https://archive.vn/DBH5l#20%) that nobody else had.

Hopefully other people contribute stuff because I'm not actually a voracious reader. I'm building it so that all contributions come in through GitHub, a system very much inspired by Homebrew.
